<h1>Web Literature</h1>
</div>

<p>This is a web template for your future website!
There will be options for adding your own data for
different purposes and it will be easily customizable.
It will be mostly written in html and css with some
javaScript, this could change through time, but for now
this seems to be the way to go. For a basic website.

<div class="headers">
<h1>Completely Customized</h1>
</div>

<p>This website will have room to grow, it will be an
ongoing project dedicated to keeping the potential buyers happy
while still keeping a stable learning environment for the developers 
working on this website</p>

<div class="headers">
<h1>Github!</h1>
</div>

<p>This website is now on github for developmental
and learning purposes, it will give the option for people to 
come help with the development of the website and to learn with us
and potentially join the team as a developer. Everybody is welcome.</p>



<div class="headers">
<h1>Registration</h1>
</div>

<p>Currently there is no database setup for registration, but it 
will be an option in the future, as stated before there is much
room for development and ideas. We could end up hosting multiple
different programs and designs based off of this website.
